19. You will now see a pop-up with your Google Client ID and Google Client Secret. Copy these values and store them securely, as you'll need them for your application's OAuth implementation.

You now have a Google Client ID and Google Client Secret for your application. Use these values in your OAuth implementation to authenticate users with their Google accounts.
