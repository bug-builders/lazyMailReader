        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our Email Assistant Slack Bot (the "Service").</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use our Service, we may collect certain information, such as your email address and email content, to provide you with the best experience possible. We only have access to information that you voluntarily give us via the Service or other direct contact from you.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We will use your information to provide the Service and improve the user experience. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request or provide the Service.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>We automatically delete copies of your emails from our servers after 2 days of inactivity. This helps protect your privacy and ensures that your data is not stored for longer than necessary. Our servers are hosted in Google Cloud in Belgium.</p>

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Service, your information is protected both online and offline. We use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online and also protect your information offline by allowing access only to employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g., customer service).</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
